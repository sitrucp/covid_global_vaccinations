## Tracking Canada's Rank Over Time

* Canada Total Doses per 100 People History - includes Canada global rank and rank percentile by total doses per 100 people and # countries in OWID dataset by date. Rank percentile captures rank independent of country count which increases with time.

* Canada Daily Doses per 100 People History - includes Canada global rank and rank percentile by daily doses per 100 people and # countries in OWID dataset by date. Rank percentile captures rank independent of country count which increases with time.

Note: 

Creating rank history required 'filling up' missing values from last available past value for days where a country does not have data available. This often occurs over weekends, or other various reasons where a country data has missing data. 

Rank percentile is based on global rank, not the actual total or daily dose value.
